# Overview
I would like to build a website for my mother where she can sell her products (t-shirts, mugs, glass blocks, etc). She currently uses Facebook for her business page, but it doesn’t fulfill her needs. Mainly, she would like a way to keep track of her orders (as opposed to receiving a message from a customer and writing down the order), and she would like a way for the customer to pay when they place the order. This website will be set up like most ecommerce sites. Customers will be able to view all of her products that have been organized into categories, search for particular products, add their items to a shopping cart (after choosing size/color/customization/etc), and pay by PayPal or Venmo. I need to set up an administrator account so that I can pass the website off to her and she can add or remove her own items/images.

# Features
* user account(s): There will be an administrator account where changes to the website can be made. I do not currently plan on letting customers create their own accounts, as I don’t see the purpose. 
* sales analysis: The administrator account will be able to access sales data. This data will be organized and displayed in charts and graphs and will help identify trends/anticipate future sales. 
* communication: There will be a page for customers to contact the seller with questions/concerns (contact form sends email to seller). There will also be automatic emails sent with a customer’s order information, and the seller will be able to confirm an order along with providing a pick-up date. 
* search: Customer will be able to search the website for a particular item. -social media: people will be able to share on Facebook/Instagram/etc

# Technologies
* Java 
* Spring Boot 
* Thymeleaf 
* MySQL

# What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn how to send automated emails, how to set up payment through an API, and certain aspects of web design that are more complicated than we learned in class.
