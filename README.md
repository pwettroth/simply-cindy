# Simply Cindy

I am building a website for my mother where she can sell her products. She currently uses Facebook for her business page, but it doesnâ€™t fulfill her needs. Mainly she would like a way to keep track of her orders (as opposed to receiving a message from a customer and writing down the order), and she would like a way for the customer to pay when they place the order. This website will be set up as an ecommerce site. Customers will be able to view all of her products that have been organized into categories, search for particular products, add their items to a shopping cart (after choosing size/color/customization/etc), and pay by PayPal or Venmo. I need to set up an administrator account so that I can pass the website off to her and she can add or remove her own items/images.
